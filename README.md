# Twitch Plays Hardware #

**v0.0** Built at Hack Into The BemyApp Factory


### Built for Windows, written in Python 3 32 BIT###

The goal of this project is to control hardware via IRC on a Twitch.tv Channel.  It takes the open source clone of the program Twitch channel "Twitch Plays Pokemon" uses and abstract it such a way we can control hardware.

For the hackathon we created a method to control a Nintendo3Ds via Arduino.

### Prerequisists: ###

Please note, this uses the PyWin32 and PySerial which requires the 32 bit version of Python 3.  This will not work on any operating system other than windows.

- **Python 3.3.4** [64 bit] [32 bit](http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.3.4/python-3.3.4.msi "32 bit")
- **PyWin32**  [32 bit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/Build%20218/pywin32-218.win32-py3.3.exe/download "32 bit")
- *If you have any dll related issues make sure you're using the right version!*
- **Pyserial 2.7** https://pypi.python.org/packages/any/p/pyserial/pyserial-2.7.win32_py3k.exe#md5=c6fb580ae7763671297794b8a1d91c9e
